# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

api:
Bosta Shipment tracking GET request here (tracking number to be used: 7234258, 13737343, 67151313 )https://tracking.bosta.co/shipments/track/:trackingNumber

3- Call the API and handle the response in a similar UI to the one attached here.

4- Build the UI completely responsive and use UI assets similar to the ones inside these images.

5- Data returned in the API is strings in English, please map it to Arabic in any way you think will be better (Make sure your app supports both languages).

6- Use the font name: Cairo (search for it) and make the font weight adjustment similar to the one shown below.

7- Use React, Redux /Context (or any state management system), and JavaScript or TypeScript in completing this task.
